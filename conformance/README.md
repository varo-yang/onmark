# Conformance fixtures

Authored `.onmark` inputs are maintained by hand. Expected `.ast.txt`,
`.linked.txt`, `.resolved.txt`, `.timeline.txt`, and `.diagnostics.txt` files
are generated golden artifacts and are not wire formats or protocol schemas.

Files under `protocol/` are different: they are checked-in wire examples and
therefore part of the versioned browser contract. They are maintained through
the protocol conformance test and reviewed as compatibility-sensitive data.

Regenerate goldens after intentionally changing public behavior:

```bash
ONMARK_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 cargo test -p onmark-core --test syntax_conformance
ONMARK_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 cargo test -p onmark-core --test binding_conformance
ONMARK_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 cargo test -p onmark-core --test resolution_conformance
ONMARK_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 cargo test -p onmark-core --test timeline_conformance
ONMARK_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 cargo test -p onmark-core --test protocol_conformance
```

Review the resulting diff before committing it. Normal test runs compare
current behavior with the checked-in artifacts and never rewrite them.
